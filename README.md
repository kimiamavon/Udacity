# Bringing the First Flying Car Taxi Service to Market

In this project, you will apply the skills they have acquired in this course to strategize how to unveil the first flying car taxi service in one of the most congested cities in America-- New York City. Your data scientist has passed you a plethora of visualizations, model outputs and aggregated statistics from a dataset containing real taxi drop offs and pick ups in New York City. 

Instructions: Create a data-backed product proposal using the outputted statistics to recommend what features the first flying taxi should have to maximize consumer delight and adoption. Evaluate the data and determine what metrics are valuable for the product goal. Specifically identify which metrics are pertinent, and call out those that are explicitly non-relevant or deceiving. Use data visualizations and at least one statistical test to develop a product proposal using data-backed evidence.
